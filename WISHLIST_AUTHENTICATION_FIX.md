# Steam Wishlist Authentication Fix

## Problem
User ID `76561198198873298` was not returning wishlist data even though they have games in their wishlist. The issue was that the Steam Web API endpoint `IWishlistService/GetWishlist/v1/` only works for **public profiles**. When a user has a private profile, this API returns 403 Forbidden.

## Root Cause Analysis
- **Public API Limitation**: The Steam Web API respects user privacy settings
- **Private Profiles**: Users with private profiles have their wishlists protected
- **Authentication Required**: To access private wishlists, we need authenticated Steam sessions (cookies)

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Multi-Approach Wishlist Retrieval
The system now tries multiple approaches in order:

1. **Public API** (IWishlistService) - works for public profiles
2. **Authenticated Access** - uses Steam session cookies for private profiles
3. **Clear Error Handling** - provides informative error messages

### 2. Key Changes Made

#### Enhanced `src/server/proxy.ts`
- **Modified wishlist endpoint** to handle both public and private profiles
- **Added cookie extraction** for Steam authentication
- **Improved error handling** with user-friendly messages
- **Added source tracking** (public-api vs authenticated)

#### Enhanced `src/server/steam-api.ts`
- **Improved error messages** for different status codes
- **Added `processAuthenticatedWishlist` method** to handle raw Steam store data
- **Better type safety** for authenticated responses

### 3. How It Works

#### For Public Profiles
```
User → Public API → Steam Web API → Wishlist Data
```

#### For Private Profiles
```
User → Steam Login → Cookies → Authenticated Request → Private Wishlist Data
```

### 4. Usage Instructions

#### For End Users
1. **Public Profiles**: Just enter the Steam ID - works automatically
2. **Private Profiles**: Must authenticate via Steam login
   - Click "Login with Steam" 
   - Grant permission to access your wishlist
   - The system will use your Steam session to access private data

#### For Developers
```typescript
// Public API (works for public profiles)
const wishlist = await steamAPI.getWishlist(steamId);

// Authenticated access (works for private profiles)
const rawData = await steamAPI.getProxiedWishlist(steamId, steamCookies);
const wishlist = await steamAPI.processAuthenticatedWishlist(rawData);
```

### 5. Testing the Fix

#### Test Script
```bash
# Run the test script
bun run test-wishlist-fix.ts

# Test with your browser
# 1. Start the development server
bun run dev

# 2. Open http://localhost:5173
# 3. Login with Steam
# 4. Enter Steam ID 76561198198873298
```

#### Manual Testing
1. **Test Public Profile**: Try any public Steam ID
2. **Test Private Profile**: Use the provided user ID after Steam authentication
3. **Verify Cookies**: Check browser dev tools for Steam cookies

### 6. Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Profile is private" | User must authenticate via Steam login |
| "No Steam cookies" | Ensure user is logged into Steam in browser |
| "Invalid Steam ID" | Use 17-digit Steam ID64 format |
| "Empty wishlist" | User may actually have no wishlist items |

### 7. Technical Details

#### Cookie Requirements
The system looks for these Steam cookies:
- `steamLogin`
- `steamLoginSecure`
- `sessionid`
- `steamRememberLogin`

#### API Endpoints Used
- **Public**: `https://api.steampowered.com/IWishlistService/GetWishlist/v1/`
- **Authenticated**: `https://store.steampowered.com/wishlist/profiles/{steamId}/wishlistdata/`

#### Error Handling
- **403**: Private profile - requires authentication
- **404**: User not found
- **500**: Server error
- **Empty**: Valid but empty wishlist

### 8. Security Notes
- **No API Key Required** for authenticated access - uses user session
- **User Consent** required for Steam login
- **Same-Origin Policy** enforced for cookie access
- **No Sensitive Data** stored on server

## Verification
The fix has been tested and confirmed to work with both public and private profiles when proper authentication is provided.
